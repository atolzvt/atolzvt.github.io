                <p>I see design as the planning and organisation of facts and assets culminating in the creation 
                    of robust polymorphic solutions to multifaceted problems. 
                    I think experience design is best considered from a holistic point view of creating solutions
                     that seamlessly adapt across touchpoints of service delivery (physical, digital and otherwise).

                    <p>  
                        I love talking with people, learning of their problems and eventually finding a solution to it. 
                        It's almost as fulfilling as what the doctor feels after making their patient's life less difficult.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My Process usually always starts with, and maybe most importantly  understanding the problem. 
                        My research background helps with the fundamentals of the scientific method of creating and 
                        testing hypotheses to understand the nature of the problem, which is usually evolving.
                        After that, I discuss with stakeholders to share ideas and understand different perspectives to finding 
                        the best solutions to business, social and design problems. 
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        When not designing you can find me crafting chord progressions and melodies on the guitar 
                        or crafting words to my 'great' fantasy novel. I see beauty not only in how things look, 
                        but more importantly in how efficiently they work. 
                        <br>
                        I love creating; for this, I switched into the experience design field from a bio-medical background.
                    </p>              
                    <p>  
                        As an entry-level designer I have lots to learn, but I'm confident in the skills 
                        I've gained so far on this journey and I'm open to opportunities to showcase and apply them, 
                        preferably within a team of talented individuals because I ultimately believe 'two is better than one'.

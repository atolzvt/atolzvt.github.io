            <div class="problem-section sec2">
                <p>Studies have shown that consuming art in a museum can help reduce stress, and boost happiness. A 2013 study even discovered 
                    that students who visited art museums performed up to 9% of a standard deviation higher in ther ability to reason critically.
                </p>
                <h3>Business Statement</h3>
                <h2><blockquote>"...We need to adopt new methods to reach a wider audience and Increase our visitor numbers."</blockquote></h2>
                <p> Kahlo Museum of Arts & Culture is a free-entry Museum/Gallery.
                    The Pandemic made it Impossiible for visitors to show up, hitting their business hard. 
                    Now, they want to widen their business, adopt new methods to reach a wider audience; 
                    and ultimately, <strong>increase visitor numbers</strong>.

                <p> I sought out, and Interviewed 8 Indivivduals who were art enthusiasts and had visited an art museum/gallery 
                    within the past 2 years. I asked them questions about their visits: reasons and frequency. I got them to talk 
                    about their experiences visitng the museums: what they liked, what frustrated them. I <strong>affinity mapped</strong> 
                    the resulting data, finding trends on Personas, Goals, and Pain points.

                <h2>The competition offered limited accessibility to their art pieces.</h2>
                <p> I analysed the websites of 4 art museums around to see what they offered in terms of accessibiltiy and community. 
                    I found that they offered <strong>limited to no Information about the art pieces</strong> they had on display, and no 
                    <strong>supporting community</strong> around the museum and its services. This became an opportunity for the solution 
                    based on the insight that some Interviewees needed motivation to actually visit the Museum.

                    the major issues voiced by the Interviewees aggregated into 2 themes.

                <h3>Ideation & Prioritization</h3>
                <p> We (myself and a team-mate) brainstromed different possibilities of how we might find a solution based on the Insights stated above, 
                    via physical and digital touchpoints. </br>
                    We used the <strong>How Might We</strong> framework in conjunction with <strong>Crazy 8s</strong> ideation method. We had 
                    different ideas for digital touchpoints (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality), to physical touchpoints
                    (printing and disseminating flyers around town) to make the Museum and their articles more accessible and bring visitors in. </p>
                <p> For the scope of the project, and budget considerations we decided a <strong>smartphone app</strong> could open up the Museum 
                    to the world, and be the basis for a community platform.

                <h3>Sketching & Wireframing</h3>
                <p> We compiled a list of proposed features that would populate the pages, based on a <strong>user flow</strong> I assumed.
                    Later on, I performed a mini ‘card-sort’ to group the functionalities and create a basic layout for the screens.                     
                </p>
                <img src="images/kahlo-assets/kahlo-sketch px.jpg" alt="sketch">
                <p> I also created a <strong>storyboard</strong> of use-case scenarios. More rounds of competitive analyses were
                    done to understand how the competition solved similar design challenges.                     
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the initial design phase continued, I made sure to base screen designs on feedback and findings from the user research.

                <p>
                    Using the completed set of digital wireframes, I created a mid-fidelity prototype for usability testing. 
                    The primary user flow I connected was for <strong>accessing curated resource lists about art pieces, accessing the community
                     features and booking tour/exhibtion tickets.</strong>

                <h2><blockquote>"...This will keep me updated on the latest at the Museum."</blockquote></h2>
                <p>The users felt happy they could access the gallery from the comfort of their devices, browse the latest showings and 
                    link up with other enthusiasts.

                <p>So, this was my first fully completed UX project, Yay!  I had started another, but had to shelve along the way and follow through 
                    with the Google-Coursera Certification Course to get in-depth knowledge, step by step help on how the whole process is done. 
                    On that note, here's a few things I’ve learned:

                    <li><p>Adding more features: More accessible and inclusive forms of interacting with the art pieces (VR/AR, 3D viewing,etc).</p></li>

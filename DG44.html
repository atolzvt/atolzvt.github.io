                <h2>How long do we have to wait?</h2>
                <p>It is globally agreed that a well-designed health system delivers timely and convenient access to health 
                    services which, in turn, affects the general health of a population and its life expectancy. 
                    Accessing this health system generally dictates that patients book and reserve appointments, usually, on arrival 
                    at the health facility and, depending on the amount of other patients waiting
                     to see the doctors, <strong>they have to wait long hours</strong>.

                    <p> 44 is a publicly funded hospital, it gets many visitors for the relativley low prices for the services available. <strong>They get complaints 
                        ever so often and want to create a system that improves the service efficiency and improve the patient satisfaction levels</strong>.

                <h2>...little chunks at a time, and trust the process.</h2>
                <p>Although the product hasn’t launched yet, the hope is to see it become a reality as it could actually help the 
                    peoples of the town access medical care less stressfully.
                    <br>
                    The users we tested with were happy with the designs, how we were able to translate their issues with the clinic service into neat solutions. 
                    Some of the projected outcomes include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>Reduction in time spent waiting for doctors (through more contextual and qualitative research).</p></li>
                        <li><p>Regulation of amount of waiting patients at a time. </p></li>
                        <li><p>A general increase in outpatient satisfaction levels. </p></li>
                    </ol>
            
                    <p>Coming back to an archived project and completing an MVP was very fulfilling. A few things I learnt and would apply next time:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Properly log every bit of data I synthesize for easy recall, they will always come in handy.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Be more bold to take more pictures.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Wording the test questions for ease of comprehension is important.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                   <p>Overall, I learnt to be comfortable in the chaos of design and believe in the process, that a solution will come.</p>
